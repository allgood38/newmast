\section{Navigation with GPS Data} % (fold)
\label{sec:Navigation with GPS Data}

The boat is going to be given certain points that it needs to reach.
These will be given to it through a data file containing the GPS
locations. Given that the boat cannot sail a straight line to the
objective, it is going to need to deal with changing wind conditions and
any other obstacles.

From this point on, the locations which the robot must reach will be called
hard coded locations. In order to reach these locations, the robot will generate
a series of in between points to take care of the challenges of sailing to the
hard coded points.
