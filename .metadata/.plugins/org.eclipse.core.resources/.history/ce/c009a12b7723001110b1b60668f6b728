 * @section intro Introduction
 * This is a complete rewrite of the original sailcode, the idea is to break
 * the main functions of the boat into reusable libraries. Each library is a
 * class with a bunch of member functions and some data structs.
 *
 * There should be a library for the Wind Sensor and compass, the Polulu, any
 * ethernet communications and maybe the sailing logic.
